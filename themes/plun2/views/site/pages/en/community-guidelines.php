            <p>In exchange for your compliance with our guidelines, PLUN.ASIA’s customer and member service team ("CMS") is committed to nurturing a respectful, fun and lawful environment where lively discussions of LGBT issues are celebrated and honored, and where appropriate action will be taken against reported violations of this safe haven.</p>
            
            <h2>Adult Photos</h2> 
            
            <p>Any member, 18 years of age or older, can upload adult photos to their profile and is required to make these adult photos private or they will be removed. We reserve the right to determine which of your photos are adult, and to deny approval of photos that do not meet our guidelines. For example, adult photos will not be approved if they depict anyone who appears under 18 years of age, or sexual activities such as bestiality, masochism, sadism or abuse.</p>
            
            <h2>Our definition of "Adult"</h2>
            
            <p>Depictions of the naked body, including individuals in sexual postures or activities and sexual engagements between or among individuals are considered adult. Every depiction that falls into this category must be identified as "adult" and uploaded to only Vault Photos section by you, the user.</p> 
            
            <h2>What types of photos are not allowed?</h2>
            
            <p>While we celebrate the diversity of the LGBT community, we do not permit certain pictures that we believe would place our business and/or our members at risk. The types of images or pictures we may immediately remove in our absolute and sole discretion are:</p>
            
            <p class="dot">* Copyrighted images where it's clear that you do not own the copyright or have permission to use; this includes cartoons and other images you may have found and downloaded while searching the web.<br>
            * Pictures of children, including pictures of you as a child. (We realize you may have the best of intentions, but in interest of keeping children safe online it is best to avoid uploading any child photos).<br>
            * An animal in any sexual position.<br>
            * Any drug paraphernalia or icons, including "poppers".<br>
            * Any sort of nudity and/or sexual activity that you did not make private.<br>
            * Any pictures where an erection is clearly visible (clothed or not) that you did not make private.<br>
            * Any "scat" pictures.<br>
            * No "water sports" or urination pictures allowed.<br>
            * Any photos depicting blood or violence, including photos of guns, knives, razors, etc.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Objectionable Content</h2>
            
            <p>Member submissions that warrant further investigation and that are subject to immediate removal from the site include depictions or descriptions of violence, bestiality, incest, child pornography and any other objectionable violations of law or user safety. Depictions that fall into the category of unacceptable adult materials are ultimately subject to PLUN.ASIA’s litmus test of violation, not the user's personal opinion. PLUN.ASIA reserves the right but is not obligated to remove any profile, including content and images, which we deem inappropriate for a particular site and its viewers</p>
            
            <h2>Taking It Offline</h2>
            
            <p>While PLUN.ASIA is a place to make friends and acquaintances, we encourage all members to act responsibly in choosing their offline interactions and in being conservative in the distribution of personal information, such as name, phone number and address. We cannot accept responsibility for what happens as a result of a connection made through PLUN.ASIA services.  PLUN.ASIA does not conduct background checks or otherwise pre-screen members for criminal histories, mental illness, etc.</p>
            
            <h2>Republishing Your Words and Images</h2>
            
            <p>As we are dedicated to sharing the best of the PLUN.ASIA community with a broader audience, we may republish your words and/or image(s) across other segments of our properties and you grant us full rights to do so without restriction.</p>
            
            <h2>No Hate Here</h2>
            
            <p>Expressions and/or threats of bigotry, hatred, harassment and abuse are not tolerated on PLUN.ASIA. Bashers are subject to immediate removal from the site no matter the status of your membership.</p>
            
            <h2>Support Each Other</h2>
            
            <p>This is your community and we encourage you to interact with each other respectfully, peacefully and thoughtfully and in accordance with the law. Below are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
            
            <p>- Don't Attack Each Other. Always "cease and report" when faced with a potential "flame" war. The CMS team is here to support you and we ask that you report the member to us, rather than engaging hostile people. While strong opinions and lively debate are welcome and encouraged, name-calling or personal attacks directed towards other members using our service is not allowed and violators will be subject to removal from the site. Please keep the conversation respectful of differing opinions, and carefully consider your comments. We urge members to work out personal differences privately.</p>
            
            <p>- Keep It Kind. Hate speech is taken extremely seriously. It is a violation of our User Agreement and will not be tolerated. This type of communication subjects you to immediate and permanent suspension of membership privileges and/or termination of your account without any right of a refund. In addition, we respectfully request that you refrain from profane, defamatory, or communications that otherwise violate the User Agreement. If you feel another member is communicating in this fashion, tell us about it.</p>
            
            <p>PLUN.ASIA asks that you refrain from using extremely explicit or vulgar language.  We do allow discussion of sexual topics, but we ask that members refrain from using terms or words normally considered vulgar or rude.</p>
            
            <h2>Youth Online</h2> 
            
            <p>A vital part of the PLUN.ASIA community is LGBT youth–those under 18 years of age. While PLUN.ASIA endeavors to build a single safe haven where all LGBT can gather and connect, our safety standards require that we uphold distinct, specific guidelines for youth areas of the site:</p>
             
            <p class="dot">1. In areas designated for youth, solicitation for sex, intimate relationships and/or offline engagements is expressly prohibited. Likewise, explicit conversations regarding sexuality are not tolerated. Adults are prohibited from entering these areas.</p>
             
            <p class="dot">2. Youth are prohibited from areas that are not approved by PLUN.ASIA for youth participation.</p>
             
            <p class="dot">3. Premium accounts are not available to youth. Any premium personal account reported to us that either has a stated age below 18 or that has a photograph depicting an individual who appears beyond a reasonable doubt to be below 18 will be immediately removed.  No refunds for these accounts are available.</p>
             
            <p class="dot">4.  Finally, if you are under 13, you may not make any submissions or register for any aspect of membership on PLUN.ASIA. See the User Agreement for more information on this.</p>
            
            <h2>Be Considerate </h2>
            
            <p>The time and energy of every member at PLUN.ASIA is valuable. We respectfully request that you refrain from repeatedly sending messages, or extending a single monologue, even with different ideas. </p>
            
            <p>Members that post commercial advertisements, including web pages that redirect users to membership-based pay-per-use sites and escort services, are subject to suspension of membership privileges, removal of content or removal from community areas. To pursue a partnership with PLUN.ASIA, email us.</p>
            
            <p>Posting offers for sale of products or services is not allowed in any part of our service with the exception of areas that we designate. If you do offer for sale products or services, you must do so in the appropriate categories only in those areas that we designate. </p>
            
            <h2>Stay Focused</h2> 
            
            <p>A great deal of thought goes into the determination of topics and in the interest of the communities that gather in those given areas, members are required to stick to the topic. Area names and titles specify the interests of those in that area. Please use these areas for the topics they were intended. Repeatedly straying off-topic may result in the suspension of membership privileges</p>
            
            <h2>Copyrighted Information</h2>
            
            <p>Information copyrighted by an individual or entity other than the author should never be posted or pasted within the PLUN.ASIA community. In the event this does occur, the individual posting or pasting this information will be held responsible. PLUN.ASIA cannot accept responsibility for this type of unlawful communication.  See our User Agreement for more information.</p>
            
            <h2>Customer & Member Service Team</h2>
            
            <p>The CMS team reserves the right but is not obligated to hide inappropriate comments, messages and/or image(s), suspend members and block select privileges, based on the standards set here and in our governing User Agreement. Above all, the CMS team has complete and sole discretion in determining if a member is complying with these guidelines or the User Agreement.</p>
            
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            
            <p>If you feel another member is violating these guidelines or the User Agreement or are uncertain whether you might be or will be in violation, do not hesitate to contact us to find out for sure.</p>
